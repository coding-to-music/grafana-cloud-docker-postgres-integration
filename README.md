## PostgreSQL and pgAdmin

This example provides a base setup for using [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) and [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/).
More details on how to customize the installation and the compose file can be found [here (PostgreSQL)](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) and [here (pgAdmin)](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/latest/container_deployment.html).

Project structure:

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â”œâ”€â”€ compose.yaml
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

[_compose.yaml_](compose.yaml)

```yaml
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:latest
    ...
  pgadmin:
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
```

## Configuration

### .env

Before deploying this setup, you need to configure the following values in the [.env](.env) file.

- POSTGRES_USER
- POSTGRES_PW
- POSTGRES_DB (can be default value)
- PGADMIN_MAIL
- PGADMIN_PW

## Deploy with docker compose

When deploying this setup, the pgAdmin web interface will be available at port 5050 (e.g. http://localhost:5050).

```shell
$ docker compose up
Starting postgres ... done
Starting pgadmin ... done
```

## Add postgres database to pgAdmin

After logging in with your credentials of the .env file, you can add your database to pgAdmin.

1. Right-click "Servers" in the top-left corner and select "Create" -> "Server..."
2. Name your connection
3. Change to the "Connection" tab and add the connection details:

- Hostname: "postgres" (this would normally be your IP address of the postgres database - however, docker can resolve this container ip by its name)
- Port: "5432"
- Maintenance Database: $POSTGRES_DB (see .env)
- Username: $POSTGRES_USER (see .env)
- Password: $POSTGRES_PW (see .env)

## Expected result

Check containers are running:

```
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                           COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS                 PORTS                                                                                  NAMES
849c5f48f784   postgres:latest                 "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   9 minutes ago       Up 9 minutes           0.0.0.0:5432->5432/tcp, :::5432->5432/tcp                                              postgres
d3cde3b455ee   dpage/pgadmin4:latest           "/entrypoint.sh"         9 minutes ago       Up 9 minutes           443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:5050->80/tcp, :::5050->80/tcp                                         pgadmin
```

Stop the containers with

```shell
$ docker compose down
# To delete all data run:
$ docker compose down -v
```

## View the header row (there should not be any column headers in the header row)

```
head -n 1 ev_locations.csv
```

## Count the columns in the header row

Counting the number of columns in the header row:

```
head -n 1 ev_locations.csv | awk -F ',' '{print NF}'
```

## Counting the number of columns in the CSV body:

```
awk -F ',' '{print NF; exit}' ev_locations.csv


13
```

## Count the number of rows in the csv file

```
wc -l ev_locations.csv

70453
```

## verify can connect from the command line

```
sudo apt install postgresql-client
```

## Install using Debian or Ubuntu's default repositories

Both Ubuntu and Debian provide versions of PostgreSQL server as packages within their default repositories. The PostgreSQL version may be older than those found on the PostgreSQL website, but this is the simplest way to install on these distributions.

To install PostgreSQL server, update your computer's local package cache with the latest set of packages. Afterwards, install the postgresql package:

```java
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql
```

By default, PostgreSQL is configured to use peer authentication, which allows users to log in if their operating system user name matches a PostgreSQL internal name.

The installation process created an operating system user called postgres to match the postgres database administrative account. To log into PostgreSQL with the psql client, use sudo to run the command as the postgres user:

```java
sudo -u postgres psql

or

psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres
```

Once you are connected to your database, run the following command to list all tables in the current schema:

```java
\dt
```

This should display a list of all tables in the current schema, including the tables you have created.

If you want to see more information about a specific table, you can use the \d command followed by the name of the table. For example, if you want to see the details of the ev_locations table, you can run:

```java
\d ev_locations
```

This should display information about the columns, constraints, and indexes defined on the ev_locations table.

You can check the current database and schema in psql by running the following command:

```java
SELECT current_database(), current_schema();
```

To list the different databases in PostgreSQL, you can use the following command in the psql command-line interface:

```java
\list
```

When you are finished, you can exit the psql session by typing:

```java
\quit
```

Try a command, always end with a semicolin;

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS mytable (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  datetime TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

verify

```
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mytable;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ev_locations;
```

```
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres
Password for user postgres:
```

Output

## Install the Grafana agent

### Check prerequisites

Replace `GCLOUD_RW_API_KEY` with your own API key.

Run this command to install and run Grafana Agent as a grafana-agent.service systemd service

```
ARCH="amd64" GCLOUD_HOSTED_METRICS_URL="https://prometheus-prod-10-prod-us-central-0.grafana.net/api/prom/push" GCLOUD_HOSTED_METRICS_ID="479670" GCLOUD_SCRAPE_INTERVAL="60s" GCLOUD_HOSTED_LOGS_URL="https://logs-prod3.grafana.net/loki/api/v1/push" GCLOUD_HOSTED_LOGS_ID="238805" GCLOUD_RW_API_KEY="GCLOUD_RW_API_KEY" /bin/sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-onboarding/agent/scripts/grafanacloud-install.sh)"
```

Output:

```

Grafana Agent is now running! To check the status of your Agent, run:
   sudo systemctl status grafana-agent.service
```

Awesome! The agent is good to go.

You are now running the agent on your machine. We automatically installed the `Agent integration`
so you can access agent metadata, dashboards, and alerts, which will help you check on the health of your agent. If you do not want this integration, you may uninstall this integration without any impact to the agent.

### Verify that the repository is properly configured using yum-config-manager:

```
yum-config-manager grafana
```

### Install Grafana Agent:

```
sudo yum install grafana-agent
```

### Operation guide

The Grafana Agent will be configured a systemd service after using the installation methods explained in the previous sections.

### Start the Agent

To run the service you just need to type:

```
sudo systemctl start grafana-agent
```

You can check the status of the running agent typing:

```
sudo systemctl status grafana-agent
```

Alternately, you can configure the Grafana Agent to restart at boot:

```
sudo systemctl enable grafana-agent.service
```

### Check prerequisites specific to the PostgreSQL integration

The PostgreSQL user is required to gather metrics. While you can use `root` user for testing, we strongly advice that you configure a separate user for the Grafana Agent, and give it only the strictly mandatory security privileges necessary for monitoring your node, as per the official documentation.

## Configure integration

Run each of these configuration snippets in the appropriate place in your config file. This example configuration provides a good model for what your configuration should look like for the first integration that you install.

Follow instructions specific to the PostgreSQL integration

For help finding your agent configuration file, refer to this documentation. https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/set-up/install-agent-linux/#operation-guide

## Integration

Below `integrations`, insert the following lines and change the URLs according to your environment:

```
  postgres_exporter:
    enabled: true
    data_source_names:
      - postgresql://root@localhost:5432
```

Enable the integration by adding the provided snippets to your Grafana Agent configuration file.

Make sure to change the `data_source_names` to the addresses of the Postgres servers you want to monitor in the agent config.

For a full description of configuration options see how to configure the `postgres_exporter_config` block in the agent documentation.

https://grafana.com/docs/agent/latest/configuration/integrations/postgres-exporter-config/

### Editing the Agentâ€™s config file

By default, the config file is located in `/etc/grafana-agent.yaml` . After editing the file with the desired config, you need to restart the agent running:

```
sudo systemctl restart grafana-agent
```

### Check the logs of running Agent

You can check the logs of running agent typing:

```
sudo journalctl -u grafana-agent
```

Output

```

## Have prisma read the table in the database and generate it's own model

To have Prisma read an existing table in the database and generate its own model, you can use the Prisma CLI's introspect command. This command inspects your database schema and generates a Prisma schema based on it.

Here are the steps you can follow:

Install Prisma CLI by running

```java
npm install -g prisma
```

Create a new Prisma schema file if you haven't already. You can do this by running prisma init in your project directory and selecting a database provider (in your case, Postgres).

In your terminal, run prisma introspect followed by the connection URL to your database, for example:

```java
prisma introspect postgres://username:password@host:port/database
```

This will introspect your Postgres database and generate a Prisma schema file based on the existing tables and columns.

After running the prisma introspect command, you should see a new schema.prisma file in your project directory. This file will contain the models and fields that Prisma has generated based on the existing database schema.
Note that Prisma's generated schema may not perfectly match your existing database schema, so you may need to make adjustments to it. For example, you may need to add or remove fields, or specify custom mappings for specific fields. Once you have made the necessary changes, you can run prisma generate to generate the Prisma client based on your updated schema.

```java
npx prisma db pull
```

```java
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma
Environment variables loaded from .env
Datasource "db": PostgreSQL database "prisma-postgresql-seeding-example", schema "public" at "localhost:5432"

âœ– Introspecting based on datasource defined in prisma/schema.prisma

Error: P1012 Introspection failed as your current Prisma schema file is invalid

Please fix your current schema manually, use prisma validate to confirm it is valid and then run this command again.
Or run this command with the --force flag to ignore your current schema and overwrite it. All local modifications will be lost.
```

Fix via force

```java
npx prisma db pull --force
```

Output

```java
Prisma schema loaded from prisma/schema.prisma
Environment variables loaded from .env
Datasource "db": PostgreSQL database "prisma-postgresql-seeding-example", schema "public" at "localhost:5432"

âœ” Introspected 3 models and wrote them into prisma/schema.prisma in 239ms

## Install Postgresql on Debian and Ubuntu

You can either choose to use the version of PostgreSQL available in your distribution's default repositories or use repositories provided by the PostgreSQL project. Packages in the default repository are tested to work with all other software provided for your distribution, but may be older. Packages from the PostgreSQL project will be more up-to-date but may require extra configuration.

[Install using Debian or Ubuntu's default repositories](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/setting-up-a-local-postgresql-database#install-using-debian-or-ubuntus-default-repositories)

[Install using the PostgreSQL project's Debian and Ubuntu repositories](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/setting-up-a-local-postgresql-database#install-using-the-postgresql-projects-debian-and-ubuntu-repositories)

## Install using Debian or Ubuntu's default repositories

Both Ubuntu and Debian provide versions of PostgreSQL server as packages within their default repositories. The PostgreSQL version may be older than those found on the PostgreSQL website, but this is the simplest way to install on these distributions.

To install PostgreSQL server, update your computer's local package cache with the latest set of packages. Afterwards, install the postgresql package:

```java
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql
```

By default, PostgreSQL is configured to use peer authentication, which allows users to log in if their operating system user name matches a PostgreSQL internal name.

The installation process created an operating system user called postgres to match the postgres database administrative account. To log into PostgreSQL with the psql client, use sudo to run the command as the postgres user:

```java
sudo -u postgres psql

or

psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U postgres
```

Once you are connected to your database, run the following command to list all tables in the current schema:

```java
\dt
```

This should display a list of all tables in the current schema, including the tables you have created.

If you want to see more information about a specific table, you can use the \d command followed by the name of the table. For example, if you want to see the details of the ev_locations table, you can run:

```java
\d ev_locations
```

To determine the name of the database and schema that you are currently connected to in psql, you can use the \conninfo command.

Simply open psql and run the following command:

```java
\conninfo
```

This should display information about the columns, constraints, and indexes defined on the ev_locations table.

```java
You are connected to database "mydatabase" as user "myuser" via socket in "/var/run/postgresql" at port "5432".
```

You can check the current database and schema in psql by running the following command:

```java
SELECT current_database(), current_schema();
```

To list the different databases in PostgreSQL, you can use the following command in the psql command-line interface:

```java
\list
```

If you've inserted rows into your database outside of Prisma, then Prisma's knowledge of the number of rows in the affected table(s) may be out of date. To update Prisma's knowledge of the row count, you can use the prisma.db.$queryRaw() method to execute a SQL query that retrieves the row count for the table.

Here's an example of how to update Prisma's knowledge of the row count for the ev_locations table:

```java
const rowCount = await prisma.db.$queryRaw(
  'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ev_locations'
);
prisma.ev_locations.count = rowCount[0].count;
```

In this example, the prisma.db.$queryRaw() method is used to execute a SQL query that returns the row count for the ev_locations table. The result is an array with a single object that has a count property. This property contains the row count for the table.

The count property is then assigned to the count property of the ev_locations Prisma client, which updates Prisma's knowledge of the row count for the table.

You can use similar code to update the row count for any other tables that you've modified outside of Prisma.

When you are finished, you can exit the psql session by typing:

```java
\quit
```

Length is populated with the accepted length - if Length is null then the street is unaccepted
Dock st is length 197 feet accepted plus 226 feet unaccepted
The rows that are most relevant have non-null length - basically ignore all rows with null length

## Counts of streets, accepted and unaccepted

```java
1128 rows

select count(*) from street;
1128

select count(*) from street where length is not null;
820

select count(*) from street where length is null;
308

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM street WHERE CAST(regexp_replace(length, '\D', '', 'g') AS INTEGER) > 0;
```

## Length of accepted streets

## Change docker-compose to be docker-stack

```
docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yml my-stack-name


docker stack deploy -c docker-stack.yml postgres-stack
```

## To stop and remove a Docker Stack and its volumes, follow these steps:

Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where your docker-stack.yml file is located.

Use the following command to remove the stack:

```java
docker stack rm my-stack-name

docker stack rm postgres-stack
```

Wait for the stack to be removed. You can use the following command to check if the stack is still running:

```java
docker stack ls
```

Once the stack has been removed, use the following command to remove its volumes:

```java
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q -f "label=com.docker.stack.namespace=my-stack-name")

docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q -f "label=com.docker.stack.namespace=postgres-stack")
```

This command will remove all volumes associated with the stack. Replace my-stack-name with the name of your stack.

You can use the following command to verify that the volumes have been removed:

```java
docker volume ls -f "label=com.docker.stack.namespace=my-stack-name"

docker volume ls -f "label=com.docker.stack.namespace=postgres-stack"
```

This command should not return any volumes.
